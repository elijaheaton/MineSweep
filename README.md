# MineSweep
A quick and incomplete MineSweeper game made with the Kivy API

TODO: Explain dependencies and how to play
TODO: Make it so that you can win
TODO: Change colors based on the number revealed
TODO: Make a recursive function to eliminate all neighbors of buttons revealed to be 0's
TODO: Generalize the app so that I don't have three different classes for three different games.
