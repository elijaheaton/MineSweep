# MineSweep
A MineSweeper game made with the Kivy API

To play, you will need to install Kivy and Numpy. While numpy can work with the latest version of Python (3.8), Kivy cannot. So you will need to revert to 3.7 for this game.

The easiest way to do this would be to activate a virtual environment. For example, you can download Anaconda. If you do, you will be able to use the following commands:

```
conda create -n minesweep python=3.7
conda activate minesweep
pip install kivy
pip install numpy
git clone https://github.com/elijaheaton/MineSweep.git
python MineSweep/MineSweep.py
```

Now you can play!
